[{"name":"Http.Detailed","comment":" Create HTTP requests that return more detailed responses.\n\nThe metadata and original body of an HTTP response are often very useful.\nMaybe your server returns a useful error message you'd like to try and decode,\nor you want to access the header of a successful response.\nUnfortunately, this information is discarded in the responses in [`elm/http`][http].\nThis module lets you create HTTP requests that keep that useful information around.\n\nThe API is designed so that usage of this module is exactly the same as using [`elm/http`][http],\nwith the only difference being that a more detailed `Result` is returned.\n\n[http]: https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/2.0.0\n\n\n# Example\n\nCreate an HTTP request like you normally would -\njust use this module's [`expect`](#expect) functions instead of the ones from the default package.\n\n    import Http\n    import Http.Detailed\n\n    type Msg\n        = GotText (Result (Http.Detailed.Error String) ( String, Http.Metadata ))\n        | ...\n\n    Http.get\n        { url = \"https://elm-lang.org/assets/public-opinion.txt\"\n        , expect = Http.Detailed.expectString GotText\n        }\n\nIf a successful response is received, a `Tuple` containing the expected body and the metadata is returned.\nYou can access a header from the metadata if needed.\n\nIn case of an error, a custom [`Error`](#Error) type is returned which keeps the metadata and body around if applicable,\nrather than discarding them.
